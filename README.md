# Go Websocket

This is a simple WebSocket server implemented in GoLang. The server provides a basic WebSocket endpoint at `ws://localhost:3000/ws` for bidirectional communication. This repository is for learning purposes only. 

## Running the Server

To run the WebSocket server, execute the following command:

```bash
make run
```
This will build and start the server, which will be accessible at `ws://localhost:3000/ws`.
